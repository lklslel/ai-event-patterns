# AI Event Patterns Repository

## Overview
`ai-event-patterns` is a curated collection of AI-friendly patterns for event handling and UI management. This repository aims to help developers and AI systems understand input-event processing, update cycles, and rendering integration across various UI contexts.

## Contents
- **Pointer Event Handling**: Clear pattern for managing pointer, mouse, and touch events with slots and bitmask flags.
- **Keyboard Event Handling**: Methods to prevent duplicate input in IME and standard key events.
- **Event Flags**: Bitmask management and per-frame event states.
- **Rendering Loop Integration**: Safe, synchronized update cycles with move-event limiting.

## Goals
- Provide AI-friendly, well-documented patterns for event processing.
- Offer conceptual clarity for implementing UI systems without enforcing a strict framework.
- Serve as a reference for developers building interactive applications.

## Usage
Clone the repository and refer to the Markdown files for each pattern. Implement the patterns in your own system while following the documented AI-friendly structure.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-event-patterns.git
```

Then explore the documentation:
- `pointer_event.md`
- `keyboard_event.md`
- `event_flags.md`
- `rendering_loop.md`

## Contribution
You can contribute by:
- Adding new AI-friendly event patterns.
- Improving existing documentation for clarity.
- Sharing practical examples and use cases.
